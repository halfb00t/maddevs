              Ethereum staking,
            </strong>
             ether stacking is the act of depositing 32 ETH to activate validator software. The user uploads 32 ethers and becomes a validator. If he does not have 32 ethers or does not want to be a validator, he can join the staking pool.

              Incentivization
