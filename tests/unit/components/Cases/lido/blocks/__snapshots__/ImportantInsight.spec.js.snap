      Mad Devs successfully completed the migration, passing all the tests and audits.
      Nonetheless, the work of both the Lido team and the Mad Devs team uncovered an intriguing pattern that deserves
      everyone's attention.

      The smart contract work with the frontend, which will also pack bytes. For the old bridge,
      it was packed from right to left, but for us, it should be packed from left to right.
      The chain tests revealed that everything was working in order. However, when the users arrived,
      the most crucial detail was uncovered. If the users did not reload the page during the migration,
      they became stuck during the operation.

      Moral: Not only is it important to make tests "green," but also to evaluate the entire system - 
        <strong>
          the user should
        know if the Smart contract has been modified (it is vital to reloading the page).
