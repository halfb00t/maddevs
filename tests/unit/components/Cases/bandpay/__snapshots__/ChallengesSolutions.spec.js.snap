      An enhanced user experience makes a product more compelling and valuable for its users.
      That is why building an intuitive dashboard was instrumental in giving a boost to the GuardRails solution.
      The data dashboard developed by Mad Devs from scratch allowed the app users to have a look inside their
      code and visualize its vulnerabilities. While working on this project, we created two versions of the dashboard.

      Freelancers had problems getting paid for their work. For their part,
      freelancers’ clients wanted to pay in installments and transfer money only when the work is completed.
      Both parties required a fast and transparent way of cooperation and needed to feel secure when working with
      one another. Moreover, clients and freelancers wanted to send and receive money quickly and conveniently.
