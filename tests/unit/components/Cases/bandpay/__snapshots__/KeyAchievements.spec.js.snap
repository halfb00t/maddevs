      The outcome of the work completed by the Mad Devs team is a fully-fledged platform where users can build
      partnerships, make agreements, pay, and get paid. BandPay safeguards its users and ensures that everyone
      remains satisfied with the final results, such as the desired deliverables and timely payments.

      While working on the BandPay solution, we managed to simplify onboarding and improve project visibility.

      To facilitate the onboarding process, we prepared sufficient project documentation and adopted
      a containerisation strategy using Docker container technology. Once assigned, a developer, be it a frontend
      or backend engineer, can quickly test and deploy the project regardless of the operating system.
      In addition, we obtained good test coverage for the code (65% coverage for 82,000 lines of the backend code).

      Consequently, it takes around 2 days to onboard a new team member in the BandPay project,
      while in other projects, the onboarding process may last up to 2 weeks.

      Mad Devs works in close collaboration with our partners from Peklo, a digital marketing studio engaged
      in BandPay’s marketing strategies and campaigns, including metrics and analytics. Our engineers implemented
      a variety of metrics in the iOS and Android applications to improve the visibility of the project.

      We added a news feed, which shows all recent activities on the platform, such as successful and unsuccessful
      payouts, generated agreements, registered and banned accounts, as well as other activities and events.
      We also added regular reports that provide information about the key metrics and alerts that notify about errors.

      As a result, BandPay is 100% visible and transparent for both the business owner and developers, who can see
      everything happening in the project. This system allows for tracking the activity of the users and collecting
      their feedback in real time. Moreover, our developers can instantly detect and fix problems, even before users
      report them. For this purpose, we extensively apply Sentry.io—a helpful tool for error handling and alerting.
