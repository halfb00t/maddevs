      Mad Devs effectively managed Clutch.co’s infrastructure costs by selecting cost-effective resources to fulfil
      the solution’s technical needs.

          Mad Devs migrated Clutch.сo microservices to Kubernetes, an open-source container-orchestration system for
          automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerised applications. Essentially, this enables
          Clutch.co to provide cost-effectiveness and high scalability, as Kubernetes takes less space and requires
          fewer resources. Kubernetes autoscaling allows optimizing resource usage by reducing the number of unused
          nodes, and the use of spot instances allows reducing costs to up to 90%.

          Mad Devs automated and optimized TeamCity agents. Now, TeamCity launches and stops agents automatically, or
          deletes them after they’ve performed tasks. In the past, all non-performing work would continue, creating
          additional expenses.

      CRM connector is a service that connects Clutch with HubSpot, a popular CRM. The service allows Clutch managers
      to work in HubSpot with Clutch data to streamline such time-consuming tasks as data syncing and data sharing.
      With it, Clutch managers get access to accurate records that can be easily shared within the platform.

      Mad Devs implemented Matchmaking and Shortlist to facilitate Clutch clients the selection of companies based on
      their requirements. Matchmaking is a form to be filled by a client. In the form, the client provides the basic
      information about the potential project to get the list of the companies that comply with the requirements.
