    Software requirements were prepared in close collaboration with the customer and with emphasis on business goals.
    Our rule is to prioritise end users’ experience: we focus on how our product will be helpful instead of focusing
    on how convenient it will be for us to develop it. Discussions and analysis helped identify eight main
    requirements.

    Identifying limitations was the next step. Internet service was expensive in 2013, so we needed a highly efficient
    system that delivers proper performance with as little mobile traffic as possible. The goal was to reduce the
    costs for the drivers and the passengers who use the mobile app. We also kept in mind the customer’s business
    costs: server resources, for instance, were limited.

    each iteration.
